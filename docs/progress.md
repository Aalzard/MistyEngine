# Progress

## Step 1 — Window + editor layout ✅

### Done
- Native window (winit) rendered by wgpu through eframe; Unity-like dark theme, OS UI font + symbol fallback.
- Dockable tabs (drag, split, float, close) in the Default layout: Hierarchy | Scene+Game | Inspector,
  Project+Console along the bottom. Window ▸ Layouts ▸ Default and toolbar Layout ▾ restore it.
- Menu bar: File, Edit, Assets, GameObject, Component, Window, Help with shortcut hints.
  Unbuilt items log a warning in the Console.
- Main toolbar: View/Move/Rotate/Scale/Rect/Transform tools (Q W E R T Y), Pivot/Center, Global/Local,
  Play/Pause/Step, Layers ▾, Layout ▾.
- Hierarchy: scene root row with `*` dirty marker, create `+` menu, search filter, select, right-click menu.
- Inspector: active toggle, name, Static, Tag/Layer, Transform foldout with draggable X/Y/Z labels, Add Component.
- Project: real `Assets` folder tree, breadcrumb, grid/list view (icon size slider), search, refresh (Ctrl+R).
- Console: Clear, Clear on Play, Collapse, Error Pause, info/warning/error toggle counters, search, detail pane.
- Game view: Display, aspect ratios with letterboxing, Scale slider, Play Focused ▾, Mute, Stats, Gizmos.
- Status bar shows the latest Console message; clicking it focuses the Console.
- Shortcuts: Ctrl+P / Ctrl+Shift+P / Ctrl+Alt+P, Ctrl+1..5, Ctrl+Shift+C, Ctrl+N, Ctrl+Shift+N, Ctrl+D, Del, Shift+D.

### Not matching Unity yet
- Transform tools are in the main toolbar (Unity 6 puts them in a Scene-view overlay).
- No tab ⋮ menu (Maximize / Add Tab), no double-click-to-maximize.
- Hierarchy has no parent/child tree, drag-reparenting, rename (F2) or multi-select. (step 3)
- Inspector edits placeholder data, not real components. (steps 3–4)
- Layouts are not saved between sessions.
- Undo/Redo, Cut/Copy/Paste not implemented.
